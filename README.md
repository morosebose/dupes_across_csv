# Uniques Across CSVs

## Description
Given two CSV files:
* One that has a column with a master list of data
* Another that has a column overlapping with the data in the master list, but may have additional data that isn't in the master

This script outputs a third CSV file that includes only the data from the second csv that isn't in the master.
